* Welcome to my blog
It's too tedious to use Jekyll, so I decide to use plain HTML
generated by org-mode instead. And I discarded all the old posts,
because I'm too lazy to port them...

If you want to leave some comments, please open a new issue at [[https://github.com/LQYMGT/lqymgt.github.io/issues][Github]].
